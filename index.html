    <p>Pure mathematics can not lie! My dear Miss Shaw, I never report myself anywhere, particularly not forthwith. Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway. You know Jo, I sometimes think that military intelligence is a contradiction in terms. Jo, did you fail Latin as well as science? I had to face my fear...that was more important than just going on living.... A tear, Sarah Jane? No, don't cry. While there's life, there's... Good grief.... It's a Stegosaurus!</p>

    <p>Rose... before I go, I just want to tell you: you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was I! t's called the TARDIS, this thing. T-A-R-D-I-S. That's Time And Relative Dimension In Space. That’s okay. Culture shock. Happens to the best of us. Ricky, if I was to tell you what I was doing to the controls of my frankly magnificent timeship, would you even begin to understand? And everybody lives, Rose! Everybody lives! I need more days like this! Go on, ask me anything; I'm on fire!</p>

    <p>Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. Brave heart, Clara. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Goodbye, Clara. I never know why. I only know who. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good!</p>

    <p>These are attack eyebrows. You could take bottle tops off with these. Why do you have three mirrors? Why don't you just turn your head? It's all right up to the eyebrows. Then it goes haywire. I don't know. But I'd probably blame the English. Don't be lasagna. I am totally against bantering. Shut it, Hoodie! My carer. She cares so I don't have to. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon. I've made many mistakes... and it's about time that I did something about that. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing.</p>
